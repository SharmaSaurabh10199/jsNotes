        Garbage Collection
1) Garbage collection is performed automatically. We cannot force or prevent it.
2) Objects are retained in memory while they are reachable.
3) Being referenced is not the same as being reachable (from a root): a pack of interlinked
4) objects can become unreachable as a whole.
5) Modern engines implement advanced algorithms of garbage collection.    

      Coding example:
      let user={
        name: 'sonu',
        age: 23,
      }

      user=null;

 # now the reference is lost to the object created, we cannot reach it, its unreachable hence it is garbage collected.
